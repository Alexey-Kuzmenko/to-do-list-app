### About project:

Since I want to work Front-end developer and find a job, I created this project as an example, which demonstrates my skills and knowledge of JavaScript.This project I did as part of the JavaScrip course. I took the idea from the course author, and I realized this app with my UI design.I hope you would like my work : )

### In this project, I use this stack of technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript(ES6+)
